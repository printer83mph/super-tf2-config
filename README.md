## Explanation
I have so many friends who try to get into Team Fortress 2 but are unable to because the default settings are horrendous. This should make it easier to set up your game for max enjoyment.

## Installation
Drag everything from ```tf/``` into your ```tf/``` folder. This should be found here: ```(wherever you installed Steam)/steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/```

Restart TF2 if you had it running, and you're good!
